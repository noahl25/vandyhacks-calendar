# VandyHacks-Calendar

Simple hackathon judging schedule creator made for the **VandyHacks** application.

# Technologies Used

Frontend:
- React, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS

Backend:
- Python, FastAPI, SQL(ite), SQLAlchemy

## The Idea

Helps prevent disorganization and confusion during Hackathons by allowing teams and judges to view and search concise and easily modifiable schedules for judging.

## How To Run

First make sure you have Node JS and Python 3.0+ installed.

To setup and run the backend, run the following commands:
```
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```
Using a virtual environment isn't required but I reccomended it to prevent any issues.  

For the frontend, in another terminal, run the following commands:
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview -- --port 5173
```
